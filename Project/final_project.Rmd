#Objective 

This study aims to investigate how a country’s level of public debt can be an obstacle to attract new foreign credit. If the country incurs high levels of debt, it is more likely that it will not be able to repay its creditor. Thus, in situations that a country’s level of public debt is too large, the creditors may choose to stop financing the country (Krugman, 1988), because of fearing a default. Using econometric methods, the objective is to verify if a country's debt level has a negative impact on foreign participation in a country's sovereign debt. 


#Motivation

In the past 50 years, emerging and developing economies experienced four big indebtedness waves, three of which ended up in financial crises. In the 1980s, the association of low real interest rates and growing debt market led certain economies to raise considerably their levels of indebtedness; the result was the well-known Latin America’s debt crisis. A decade later, the world would watch the Asian financial crisis, due to the liberalization of financial markets and capital flows, allowing these countries to acquire loans in foreign currencies. Finally, in 2007-09, both emerging and advanced economies faced major recessions as a result of the global financial crisis.
 
It is important to notice that although happening in different decades and locations, these three episodes share a common denominator: they all started in periods with low real interest rates and an escalating indebtedness. This scenario made the risk premium rise and subsequently there was a sudden stop of capital flows. 
 
In 2010, the fourth global wave of debt started, and it was the largest and fastest one. In accordance with the aforementioned ones, interest rates were low since the Global Financial Crisis and investors were seeking assets with greater profitability. It is also reasonable to consider that this wave has not yet met its end. By 2018, according to the IMF, global debt has reached 226% of GDP, representing an amount of 188 trillions of dollars.  Emerging and developing economies saw indebtedness grow 54 p.p. in 8 years, reaching 170% of GDP. Low income countries reached 67% of GDP in 2018 – that figure was 48% in 2010. A different situation is seen on advanced economies, once they have maintained the 265% ratio of debt to GDP on the same level since 2010.
 
Global debt waves have shown the need for emerging and developing markets to develop their sovereign bond markets to facilitate public debt financing and management, primarily through the issuance of domestic bonds in local currencies. This growth was reflected in the increase in domestic participation in government bonds, and in the increase in foreign interest in the debt of these governments, which has become increasingly relevant in the local bond market.
 
The raise in foreign participation in the sovereign debt market is also related to many susceptible advantages, such as a decrease in government borrowing costs, due to the higher demand for these bonds, presented in several studies (Andritzky, 2012; Arslanalp and Poghosyan, 2014; Jaramillo and Zhang, 2013; Warnock and Warnock, 2009) and the diversification of the investor base, reflecting different characteristics of investors in terms of risk tolerance and trading reasons, which may increase the liquidity of government debt bonds in the secondary market (World Bank and IMF , 2001).
 
However, foreign investors tend to be relatively more sensitive to risk, particularly foreign private investors, and can be an unstable source of demand in times of stress, because they have a broader pool of assets in which they can invest. As a result, they may be less inclined to maintain their participation during these episodes (Broner et al., 2013).
 
The constant rise in indebtedness, observed in the current wave of global debt and intensified by the current crisis of COVID-19, may culminate in a sudden increase in risk premiums, if investors consider debt to GDP levels to be unsustainable (Blanchard 2019; Henderson 2019; Rogoff 2019a, b). If this happens, both capital inflows and outflows decrease during economic crises, with this effect being stronger in global crises (Broner et al., 2013).
 
In this context, this study intends to analyze the impact of the variable debt-to-GDP ratio on the participation of foreign creditors in government bonds. Therefore, a worldwide analysis will be conducted using the database provided by Arslanalp and Takahiro Tsuda, previously affiliated with the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the International Monetary Fund. If this relationship proves to be significant, several negative effects on local economies, as mentioned in the text, may intensify in the current world crisis scenario.




# Literature Review

Discussions on how indebtedness can affect the macroeconomic variables of a country are widely addressed in the literature. This review will focus on three topics: debt and growth; debt overhang and debt tolerance.

The relationship between debt and growth was first found to be non-linear by Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003). Later, Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) analyze countries distinguishing developed and emerging markets and they found out that, for both groups, a 90% debt to GDP ratio can be detrimental for growth. On the other hand, Kumar and Woo (2010) produced evidence that the negative impact of debt on growth is higher for developing countries when compared with developed countries. 
Thinking about debt tolerance, Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) introduce the concept of debt intolerance and analyze how emerging markets find it difficult to face high levels of debt, while advanced countries face this issue more easily.  Later, Catão and Kapur (2006) discussed the macroeconomic determinants of a country’s volatility and how it impacts the spread rate it has to pay.

The concept of debt overhang refers to a debt burden so large that the country can not take any additional debt to finance itself. Krugman (1988) discussed the tradeoff for creditors when facing a debt overhang: financing or forgiving. Deshpande (1995) discusses how a situation of debt overhang can discourage investment. Reinhart, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2012) punctuated the main episodes in history about debt overhang.





# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study is composed by the database provided by Arslanalp and Takahiro Tsuda (2012 and 2014), which compiles comparable estimates of investor holdings of sovereign debt. In addition, data provided bt the World Economic Outlook from IMF and the WOrld Bank are used. The dataset is composed of 45 countries and covers sixteen years, from 2004 to 2019, quartely frequncy.

# Stylized Facts

Firstly, some stylized facts will be explained in relation to our dataset.


## Countries have different indebtedness levels

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mundo <- world %>%
  mutate(name_long = str_replace_all(string = name_long, pattern = "Russian Federation", replacement = "Russia"),
         name_long = str_replace_all(string = name_long, pattern = "Republic of Korea", replacement = "Korea"))

mundo <- mundo %>% 
  select(-c('continent':'gdpPercap')) %>% 
  rename(country = name_long) %>% 
  full_join(dataset_total, by = "country") %>% 
  mutate(debt_to_GDP_ = as.numeric(debt_to_GDP_))

mundo %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mundo, aes(geometry = geom), fill = "lightgrey") +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = debt_to_GDP_)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "(%)", option = "magma", trans = "sqrt", direction = -1) +
  ggtitle("Debt to GDP") +
  labs(subtitle = "Mean 2004-2019") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 17)) +
  #transition_states(year,
                      #transition_length = 2,
                      #state_length = 1) +
  coord_sf(ylim = c(-50, 90))

legend.title = element_text(colour="blue", size=10, 
                            face="bold")
  

```

As the map shown above makes clear, countries around the world have contrasting levels of debt to GDP. Nations in grey are not part of our sample. 






## Advanced markets are more indebted than emerging markets

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 graph_debt_sep<-dataset_total %>% 
   filter(!is.na(develop)) %>% 
   rename(Type=25) %>% 
  group_by(year, Type) %>% 
  summarise(debt_to_GDP_mean = mean(debt_to_GDP_)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = debt_to_GDP_mean, color=Type )) +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("EM" = "red4", "AM" = "navyblue"))+
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()+
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Debt to GDP ratio (%)", title = "Average Debt to GDP Ratio for Advanced and Emerging Markets") +
    theme_light()

graph_debt_sep

```





## Foreign investors have a preference for allocating their resources in advanced markets

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 
graph_debt_foreign_sep<-dataset_total %>% 
 filter(!is.na(develop)) %>% 
 rename(Type=25) %>% 
mutate(foreign_debt_USD=(foreign_debt_*fx_)) %>% 
group_by(year, Type) %>% 
summarise(debt_foreign_mean = mean(foreign_debt_USD)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = debt_foreign_mean, color=Type )) +
 scale_color_manual(values = c("EM" = "red4", "AM" = "navyblue"))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Foreign investors (billion USD)", title = "Total Debt Held by Foreign Investors for Advanced and Emerging Markets") +
  theme_bw()

graph_debt_foreign_sep
```


It is possible to observe that foreign investors have allocated much more resources in bonds from advanced markets. In addition, we can see that since 2012, the participation of foreign investors in government bonds has accelerated.

```


## The participation of domestic investors in the composition of debt it is not invariant over time

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 graph_debt_domestic_sep<-dataset_total %>% 
   filter(!is.na(develop)) %>% 
   rename(Type=25) %>% 
  mutate(domestic_debt_USD_prop=(domestic_debt_/total_debt_)*100) %>% 
  group_by(year, Type) %>% 
  summarise(debt_domestic_mean = mean(domestic_debt_USD_prop)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = debt_domestic_mean, color=Type )) +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("EM" = "red4", "AM" = "navyblue"))+
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()+
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Domestic Investors (%)", title = "Total Debt Held by Domestic Investors for Advanced and Emerging Markets") +
    theme_bw()

 graph_debt_domestic_sep

```


In addition to the domestic participation in debt varying for both emerging and advanced countries, it is possible to infer that those variations are inverse.



## There is no clear relationship between debt and inflation
